At the center of discussions for several years now, the American police force's methods are more and more questioned. The latter are allegedly the result of an institution that is discriminating against ethnic minorities and using racial profiling.
In this study, we have attempted to address the issues that follow:

* What is the profile of people killed by the Police?
* What are the characteristics of the places where these people are killed?

In an attempt to answer these questions, we first used univariate and bivariate analyses, then performed a Principal Component Analysis and finally a Hierarchical Ascending Classification.
We show that the majority of the individuals killed are white males who are 37 years old on average, and that the main cause of death is by gunshot. In addition, white people are more likely to be killed by gunshot than black people. Finally, the majority of people killed are killed in places with below average income.
This analysis shows that income level is the most important factor in determining the location of those killed, that Southern states -with lower incomes- have opposite economic profiles to those in the Northeast, and also higher total fatalities.
